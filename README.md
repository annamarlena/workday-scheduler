# Workday Scheduler

## Objective

The objective was to create a day planner page that updates with the correct day and date at the top of the page, and keeps track of the current hour in hour blocks for a regular workday. Past hours are gray, the current hour is red, and future hour blocks are green. When the user enters text into one of the hour blocks and clicks save, the text is saved. 

## What I Learned

I learned a lot about using jQuery and also dynamically generating the divs for the hour blocks. This did cause me trouble later on when I wanted to create the event listener. I'm still struggling to grasp how to capture local storage.
