# Workday Scheduler

## Objective

The objective was to create a day planner page that updates with the correct day and date at the top of the page, and keeps track of the current hour in hour blocks for a regular workday. Past hours are gray, the current hour is orange, and future hour blocks are minty-colored. When the user enters text into one of the hour blocks and clicks save, the text is theoretically saved. (Still working on this piece.)

## What I Learned

I learned a lot about using jQuery and also dynamically generating the divs for the hour blocks. This did cause me trouble later on when I wanted to create the event listener because the divs weren't originally created in the DOM. I'm still struggling to grasp how to capture local storage and save the entered text.
